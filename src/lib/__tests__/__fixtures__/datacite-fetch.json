  "abstract": "Road accident statistics are collected from information about personal injury road accidents and their consequent casualties, to a common national standard. The aim of collecting and publishing national road accident statistics is to inform public debate and to provide the basis for determining and monitoring effective road safety policies to reduce the road accident casualty toll. They are an essential requirement for monitoring targeted reductions in road accident casualties. The credible monitoring of targeted reductions requires that data are reported consistently and accurately, and both national and local government, and local reporting police forces, work closely to achieve a common reporting standard.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUsers should note that for 1985-1991, and from 2002 onwards, the Vehicle Record file does not contain breath test data. This change has been made in order to protect confidentiality.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nData for 1985-1990 were deposited at the Archive at the beginning of 2006. Prior to this, the Archive only held the &lt;i&gt;Road Accident Data&lt;/i&gt; series from 1991 onwards. No extra documentation was available for the 1985-1990 data, so users are advised to consult the documentation for the 1991 survey.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFurther information about the &lt;i&gt;Road Accident Data&lt;/i&gt; series and research based on it may be found on the government &lt;a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/road-accidents-and-safety-statistics\" title=\"road accidents and safety statistics\"&gt;road accidents and safety statistics&lt;/a&gt; webpages.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThese studies comprise information gathered using STATS19 and STATS20 forms.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;",
